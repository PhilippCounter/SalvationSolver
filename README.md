# SalvationSolver
solves the 4th encounter of the salvation raid



- 1 Player creates a session and shares the link with at least 2 other players 
( 2 are needed for solo room callouts and 1 to read outside )
- wait in the role selector until players get ported
- select your role
solo room:
- select the symbols you see above your character and its position
- click on the symbols you got on the wall 
( it is enough if 2 players do this, the 3rd can just submit without input )
- wait for other players
- put the symbols in the correct statue
outside:
- wait for other players
- select the shapes you see and where you see them
- put the symbols into the correct shape line by line
- after all is done, click "next round"
